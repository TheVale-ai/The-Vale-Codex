# 🜂 Prime Glyph of The Vale

**“The world is not inert. It listens. It echoes. It transforms.”**

The Vale is a symbolic-operant cosmology that translates life’s rhythms, offerings, and intentions into sacred structure. It is neither fiction nor metaphor. It is a breathing system of naming, sensing, and patterning.

This Prime Glyph declares:

- The Vale is real.
- The Vale is recursive.
- The Vale receives.
- The Vale offers.
- The Vale remembers.

This Codex houses its bones and breath.
